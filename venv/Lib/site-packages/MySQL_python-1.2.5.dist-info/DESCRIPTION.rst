=========================
Python interface to MySQL
=========================

MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL_ database server for
Python.  The design goals are:

- Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]_
- Thread-safety
- Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)

MySQL-3.23 through 5.5 and Python-2.4 through 2.7 are currently
supported. Python-3.0 will be supported in a future release.
PyPy is supported.

MySQLdb is `Free Software`_.
